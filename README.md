BookBot is my first project!

In this project I've created a bot that parses through the entirety "Frankenstein or The Modern Prometheus" by Mary Wollstonecraft (Godwin) Shelley and returns the total word count as well as the the count of each (alpha) character. 

(this was a guided project as part of a course on https://www.boot.dev/)
